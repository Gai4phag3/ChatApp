  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: August 2025</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you create an account, we collect personal information such as your full name, username, and password. Your password is securely hashed before being stored to protect your security. We also collect information about your friends and messages to enable our chat services.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. How We Store Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Firebase Firestore</a> to store your account data, friends list, and messages. Firestore is a secure, cloud-hosted NoSQL database with robust security measures to protect your data.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Password Security</h2>
    <p>Your password is never stored in plain text. We use a strong hashing algorithm called <a href="https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bcrypt</a> to hash your password on the client side before sending it to Firestore. This ensures your password is protected even if our database were to be compromised.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your information is used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain our services</li>
      <li>Enable you to connect and chat with friends</li>
      <li>Improve user experience</li>
      <li>Secure your account</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information. Your data is only shared with other users as necessary to enable friend connections and messaging.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can control your privacy settings within the app. You may also delete your account at any time, which will remove your data from our database.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date above. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
